		The Road Not Taken

		Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
		And sorry I could not travel both
		And be one traveler, long I stood
		And looked down one as far as I could
		To where it bent in the undergrowth;

		Then took the other, as just as fair,
		And having perhaps the better claim,
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
		Though as for that the passing there
		Had worn them really about the same,

		And both that morning equally lay
		In leaves no step had trodden black.
		Oh, I kept the first for another day!
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
		I doubted if I should ever come back.

		I shall be telling this with a sigh
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
		I took the one less traveled by,
		And that has made all the difference.

		- Robert Frost
